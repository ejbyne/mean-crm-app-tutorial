# Mean CRM App Tutorial (Mean Machine)

## Summary

This was a tutorial contained in the [Mean Machine](https://leanpub.com/mean-machine) book by Chris Sevilleja and Holly Lloyd.

It creates a Mean stack application and was really useful for learning how to use MongoDB, Mongoose and Node.js to create an API on the server side, and then how to create an AngularJS MVC structure on the client side in order to integrate that API.

The tutorial also taught me how to create user login/authentications with Node.js.

Unfortunately the tutorial did not contain any advice on testing and my intention is to rebuild a similar app using TDD.
